 The goal of this project is to predict the success of a product launch based on various factors such as Price, Marketing Budget, Sales Volume, 
 Customer Rating, and technical features like RAM and Battery Capacity. The objective was to build a model that could predict whether a product
 launch would be successful (binary outcome: 0 for failure, 1 for success) and identify the key factors influencing success.
